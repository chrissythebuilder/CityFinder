Day 6 of Wes Bos's 30-day JS challenge

### Main Learnings:
utilized the fetch method for retrieving information from a json 

promise only states that there is a potential for data to be returned but for it to be presented, fetch must be followed by .then to call the data 

the ES6 Spread Operator allows a shorter and cleaner presentation of the array, shows as "..." prior to the data variable when pushed, makes it easier to pull data from the json
